The [Swift Differentiable protocol](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147) allows one to build differentiable manifolds, define vector fields on them, and evolve flows generated by such fields. I'm learning about these and pushing my code here.

## Prerequesites
You need build this using a [recent development Swift toolchain](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) to have access to the [Differentiable protocol](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147). Import it using

```swift
import _Differentiation
```
in any Swift file where you'd like to build structs, functions, etc that are differentiable.
